Step 7:&nbsp; Removing Full Rows and Keeping Score</b></font><hr color="#e88100">
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Our game is close to being complete -- or at least complete 
	enough that it can be fun to play.&nbsp; All that remains is removing full 
	rows (since filling rows is the object of Tetris) and keeping score.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Writing removeFullRows:<br>
	This function will clear any full rows (rows that do not contain the empty color)
	from the board, move the rows above them down, and fill the top with empty rows.
	To do this, we'll create a new board and will only copy into it rows from the old board
	that are not full (in the correct order, of course). We'll also keep track of
	the number of full rows that are removed in a variable, fullRows. Once all the non-full
	rows are copied over, we'll add empty-color rows to the top of the new board until
	it's the right size. We then call removeFullRows in placeFallingPiece, so that full rows are cleared at the first possible opportunity.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Now that we are removing rows, we should keep score.&nbsp; 
	To do that, we will introduce a data value "score" (which is set to 
	zero in the init function).&nbsp; In our removeFullRows function, we will 
	increment the score by the <i>square</i> of total number of full rows 
	removed in order to reward removing 
	multiple lines at once.&nbsp; And now that we are keeping score, we should 
	also display the score, which involves adding a function drawScore which is 
	called by our draw function.<br>
	&nbsp;</p></li>

<li>At the end of this stage, your Tetris board should be complete!<br><br>
