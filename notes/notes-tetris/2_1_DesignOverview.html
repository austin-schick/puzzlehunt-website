Step 1:&nbsp; Design Overview</b></font>

<hr color="#e88100">
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">These notes assume that you are familiar with the game of 
	Tetris.&nbsp; If not, we suggest that you first read the
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Wikipedia entry on Tetris</a> 
	and then play the game a bit.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">These notes also assume that you are familiar with Python and Tkinter as we have used them in our 15-112 course.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Here is Tetris approximately as we will write it:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; applet:&nbsp; <a href="tetris.html">tetris.html</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; jar file:&nbsp; <a href="tetris.jar">tetris.jar</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; zip file:&nbsp; <a href="tetris.zip">
	tetris.zip</a> (which is just a zip file containing tetris.jar)<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Actually, those are Java applets/programs, and we will write ours in Python, but this can give you a clear idea of our design.</span><br>
	As should be clear when you run it, this is a simplified version of Tetris, 
	and many interesting features have been left for you to add as bonus (see 
	step 8 for details, though also note that bonus points vary by semester).<br>
	<br>
	And here is a picture of the game in action:<br>
	<br>
	<img src="pix/goal.png" border="0" width="250"><br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Our design includes two main elements:&nbsp; a <i>board</i> 
	and a <i>falling piece</i>.&nbsp; In the picture, the board contains all 
	blue (empty) cells except in the bottom three rows, where it contains 
	various other colors.&nbsp; The falling piece is the red piece in the 
	picture.&nbsp; In our design, this is <i>not</i> part of the board, but is 
	drawn <i>over</i> the board.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">More specifically, the <i>board</i>
is a 2-dimensional list of color names (strings like "red", "blue",
"green").&nbsp; Initially, the board is full of one color, the
emptyColor ("blue" in our sample code).&nbsp; As falling pieces are
transferred onto the board, other colors are introduced.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">The goal of the game is to fill rows entirely with non-empty 
	colors.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">The <i>falling piece</i> is a 2-dimensional list of 
	booleans, indicating whether the given cell is or is not painted in this 
	piece.&nbsp; For example, here is the definition of an S piece:<br><font color="#800000">
<pre>    sPiece = [
        [ False,  <span style="background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">True</span>,  <span style="background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">True</span> ],
        [  <span style="background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">True</span>,  <span style="background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">True</span>, False ]
    ]</pre>
	</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">As noted, the falling piece is not part of the board, but drawn over 
	the board.&nbsp; It becomes part of the board when it can no longer fall and 
	we place it on the board, which will not happen until several steps from now 
	in our design process.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">The game is graphical and event-based.&nbsp; This is 
	achieved by using Tkinter as we have in previous animations.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Important debugging hint:  you almost surely will want to
	add pausing (say, with "p"), unpausing (also with "p", or maybe
	"g" for "go"), stepping while pausing (with "s"),
	and resetting / calling init() again
	(say with "r").  These can be invaluable
	when trying to debug animations.</p>
