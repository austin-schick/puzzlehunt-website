Step 5:&nbsp; Rotating the fallingPiece</b></font>

	<li>
	<p align="left">This is generally the most difficult part of the project:&nbsp; 
	in response to up-arrow key presses, we should rotate the falling piece 90 
	degrees counterclockwise.&nbsp; We do this in the same way we handled other 
	changes to the falling piece:&nbsp; we make the change, test if it is legal, 
	and if it is not, we unmake the change.<br>

	<li>
	<p align="left">Explaining rotateFallingPiece:<br>
	As noted, this function (which takes one parameter, data)
	is similar to moveFallingPiece, in that it makes the 
	rotation and then calls fallingPieceIsLegal (the same function used by 
	moveFallingPiece) and undoes any illegal changes.&nbsp; As for the actual 
	rotation, this is accomplished by changing the two-dimensional list of 
	booleans that represent the falling piece.&nbsp; A new 2d list is created, 
	and cells in the old list are mapped to cells in the new list according to a 90-degree 
	counterclockwise rotation.&nbsp; To see how this works, consider this 
	picture, which shows a grid that is rotated counterclockwise (the corners 
	are highlighted to make the rotation clear):<br>

	<i><br>
	[To avoid any confusion, note that it would not be possible to generate 
	these particular boards during an actual Tetris game.]<br>
	</i><br>
	First, we see that the dimensions reverse:&nbsp; in this example, the old 
	grid was 7 rows by 10 columns, whereas the new grid is 10 rows by 7 columns.&nbsp; 
	Next, consider what happens as we move in the old grid from red to green 
	(that is, moving downward with rows increasing from 0 to 6):&nbsp; this maps 
	in the new grid to moving <span style="font-style: italic;">across</span> with columns increasing from 0 to 6 .&nbsp; 
	Thus, <i>our new column is equal to our old row</i>.&nbsp; That is the 
	easier dimension.&nbsp; Now consider the other dimension, as we move in the 
	old grid from red to white (that is, moving across with columns increasing 
	from 0 to 9:&nbsp; this maps in the new grid to moving <i>up</i> with rows
	<i>decreasing</i> from 9 to 0.&nbsp; Thus, <i>our new row is equal to (9 
	minus our old column)</i>.&nbsp; More generally, we replace "9" with "one 
	less than the number of old columns".<br>&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Writing rotateFallingPiece:<br>
Following the plan just described, we start by storing the old piece
(the 2d list of booleans), its location, and its dimensions in local
variables (because we may need these to undo our move if it turns out
to be illegal).&nbsp; Next, we compute the new dimensions, by reversing
the old dimensions.<br>
	<br>
	Next, we compute the new location.&nbsp; Our goal is to keep the center of 
	the falling piece constant (or, given that this is not possible if we have 
	an even number of rows or columns, to keep the center as constant as possible).&nbsp;
	<u>Keeping the center of the falling piece constant during rotation is the 
	most difficult part of Tetris</u>,
so read this part very carefully (though that is always good advice!).
Besides making rotation more intuitive, we want to keep the center
constant so that if we rotate around and around, the center does not
"drift" -- a full 360 degree turn should bring us back to where we
started. &nbsp;
<br><br>
To make this happen, we observe that the center row of the falling piece
can be computed as the sum of its top row plus half its height in rows.
That is:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;centerRow = fallingPieceRow + fallingPieceRows/2
<br><br>
Now, we actually have two pieces -- the old falling piece, before the rotation,
and the new falling piece, after the rotation.  We can compute each of
their centers as such:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oldCenterRow = oldRow + oldRows/2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;newCenterRow = newRow + newRows/2
<br><br>
Note that oldRows and newRows are not the same, since the dimensions change
when the piece is rotated.  In any case, to keep the old and new centers
the same, we just set oldCenterRow equal to newCenterRow in the equations
above.  Then we solve for newRow, and that gives us the new value
for fallingPieceRow.  Repeat for the columns, and voila!
<br><br>
At that point, we have 
	the new location and dimensions, so we create an entirely new piece (that is, a 
	new 2d list of booleans) and load it with a rotation of the old piece 
	according to the algorithm described above, then set fallingPiece equal to 
	this new 2d list.<font color="#800000" face="Courier New" size="2"><br>
	</font><br>
Finally, we check if this rotation makes the falling piece go off the
board or collide with a non-empty cell on the board (simply reusing our
code from the previous steps, where we wrote a function that tests if
the current board is legal or not), and if either of these conditions
occurs, we restore the piece, its location, and its dimensions to their
original values.<font color="#800000" face="Courier New" size="2"><br>

	<li>
	<p align="left">Updating keyPressed:<br>
	We modify keyPressed to call rotateFallingPiece in response to 
	an up-arrow key press.<br>&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Testing the code<br>
	Hint:&nbsp; Remember to press the up-arrow key to rotate the falling piece 
	(and try to move it off the board!), and to press some non-arrow keys to 
	start with new falling pieces to test the code!&nbsp; Verify that the piece 
	rotates counterclockwise, that the center basically stays fixed, and in 
	particular that a 360 degree turns result in no change to the falling piece.</p>
