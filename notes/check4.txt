Be sure to watch the videos very carefully, and not just
skip ahead to the parts required to answer these questions!

Be *very brief* in your answers!  Seriously.  Brief.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Your full name and andrew id:

2. The full names and andrew id's of your groupmates (if you worked collaboratively).


3. 1d Lists and Tuples

3.1: Why is type([1,3,5,7]) == type(["a", "b", "c", "d"]) True?

3.2: What do you think a[:2] is, if a = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]? Check to see if you're right after making a prediction.

3.3: What problems could arise in your code due to function parameters being aliases?

3.4: Why should you check (if value in a) before calling a.index(value)?

3.5: If a = [2, 3, 4, 5], what happens when you run a.insert(1, 42)?

3.6: What happens if you call .pop() on an empty list?

3.7: We demonstrated two correct ways to swap elements in a list. Which do you think is clearer?

3.8: Why is it a bad idea to modify a list while looping through it?

3.9: Is [] < [0]? Why or why not?

3.10: We demonstrated multiple ways to make a non-aliased copy of a. Which one do you think is best and why?

3.11: Write a line of code that sorts a list of strings based on the length of the strings.

3.12: Why do some list functions not use return statements?

3.13: How are tuples different from lists?

3.14: Write a list comprehension that has the same result as the following code:

lst = []
for i in range(10):
    lst.append(i * 3)

3.15: We can change the delimiter (the text that separates values) in a piece of text using a combination of split and join. Write a line of code that change's the delimiter of the string s from "\t" to ",".


4. Graphics questions:

4.1: How would you modify the provided code to make a 400x800 window?

4.2: What do the four main variables in create_rectangle represent?

4.3: How do you get rid of the rectangle's outline?

4.4: Why do we use rectWidth/2 and rectHeight/2 instead of rectWidth and rectHeight when drawing the inner rectangle?

4.5: Find the RGB values for your favorite color on http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm and write a line of code to generate a rectangle in that color. Paste your code here.

4.6: How did we change the position of the 'Carpe Diem!' text without changing the given x and y values?

4.7: Why did we use x1 instead of x0 + width*3/3 for the third stripe of the flag?
