<li><a name="netneutrality"></a><b>Net Neutrality</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">Net Neutrality</a> is a policy which states that the internet is essentially a utility. It holds that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should treat all legal traffic which passes through the internet equally.</li>
    <li>Example: the Netflix dilemma. Netflix (and other video streaming services) take up <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/05/28/netflix-now-accounts-for-almost-37-percent-of-our-internet-traffic/?utm_term=.798525c52bdb">over a third of internet traffic</a>. Should video streaming services be charged more? Or should they be able to pay for access to 'fast lanes'?</li>
    <li>Pros: Encourages competition, prevents content discrimination</li>
    <li>Cons: Stifles innovation, burden of regulation</li>
    <li>Essential questions:
      <ul>
        <li>Do you think the internet is a communication utility or an information service?</li>
        <li>Should ISPs be regulated or not?</li>
      </ul>

<li><a name="history"></a><b>History</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>In 2015, the FCC released <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-24A1.pdf">FCC 15-24</a>, a report and order on Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet.  In this 400 page document the FCC outlines new regulations for internet service providers designed to safeguard what they call the open internet.  There was a tremendous amount of debate at the time, and many internet service providers vowed to fight the order in court.</li>
    <li>In the document, the FCC outlines its three "Brightline Rules".  Here are some quotes/excerpts from FCC 15-24 describing those rules:
      <ul>
        <li><b>No-Blocking.</b> First, we adopt a bright-line rule prohibiting broadband providers from blocking lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices. This “no-blocking” principle has long been a cornerstone of the Commission's policies. While first applied in the Internet context as part of the Commission's Internet Policy Statement, the no-blocking concept dates back to the Commission's protection of end users' rights to attach lawful, non-harmful devices to communications networks.</li>
        <li><b>No-Throttling.</b> Second, we adopt a separate bright-line rule prohibiting broadband providers from impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, application, service, or use of non-harmful device. This conduct was prohibited under the commentary to the no-blocking rule adopted in the 2010 Open Internet Order. However, to emphasize the importance of this concept we delineate under a separate rule a ban on impairment or degradation, to prevent broadband providers from engaging in behavior other than blocking that negatively impacts consumers' use of content, applications, services, and devices.</li>
        <li><b>No Paid Prioritization.</b> Third, we respond to the deluge of public comment expressing deep concern about paid prioritization.  Under the rule we adopt today, the Commission will ban all paid prioritization subject to a narrow waiver process.

"Paid prioritization" refers to the management of a broadband provider's network to directly or indirectly favor some traffic over other traffic, including through use of techniques such as traffic shaping, prioritization, resource reservation, or other forms of preferential traffic management, either (a) in exchange for consideration (monetary or otherwise) from a third party, or (b) to benefit an affiliated entity.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In 2017 the FCC announced its intention to rollback those rules.  After an open comment period where the vast majority of comments from individuals, companies, and other organizations were in favor of maintaining the rules, in November 2017 the FCC announced its intention to rollback the rules anyway.</li>
    <li>That is where we stand today.</li>
