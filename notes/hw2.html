CMU 15-112 Spring 2018: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science<br>
Homework 2 (Due Saturday 27-Jan, at 8pm)
</h1>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>This assignment is <span class="solo">SOLO</span>. This means you may not look at other student's code or let other students look at your code for these problems. See the syllabus for details.
</li>
<br>

<li>To start:
<ol>
<li>Go to your folder named 'week2'</li>
<li>Download both
    <a href="hw2.py" download>hw2.py</a>
    and
    <a href="cs112_s18_week2_linter.py" download>cs112_s18_week2_linter.py</a>
    to that folder</li>
<li>Edit hw2.py using Pyzo</li>
<li>When you are ready, submit hw2.py to Autolab. For this hw, you may submit up to 10 times, but only your last submission counts.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Do not use lists or recursion this week.</li>
<li>Do not hardcode the test cases in your solutions.</li>
</ul>

<br><li><b>Lab Problems</b> [10pts]<br>
Attend your scheduled lab on Friday. While there, complete the basic problem and make a real attempt at the advanced problem. One of the TAs will record your participation by hand.</li>

<br><li><b>Piazza Post</b> [5pts]<br>
To succeed in 15-112, you'll need to understand how to use the course resources. Towards that end, by 8pm Saturday 1/27 you must ask a question on Piazza about the colab, homework, or coding in general. This has to be a real question! We will check for this after Saturday and will add points on Autolab manually at that point. If you have already asked a question on Piazza, we will count that question for credit (though you're still encouraged to ask more questions!).</li>

<br><li><b>Reasoning over Code</b> [10pts]<br>
Given the function roc2 (shown below), find a value that will make roc2 return True. You should then modify the function roc2Answer() to return that value so that the autograder will accept your work.<br><br>

<div class="python-code no-run no-viz">
def roc2(s):
    a = 0
    b = 0
    for i in range(1, len(s), 2):
        if s[i] in s[:i]:
            continue
        elif s[i] in string.whitespace:
            a += 1
        elif "A" <= s[i] <= "Z":
            b += 1
    return len(s) < 10 and a > 1 and a == b
</div><br>

<br><li><b>nthHappyPrime</b> [25 pts]<br>
Write the function nthHappyPrime(n) that, of course, finds the nth happy prime. Prime we know already, but what is a happy number? To find out, read the first paragraph on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number">the Wikipedia page</a>. For our purposes, we can simplify the process of finding a happy number by saying that a cycle which reaches 1 indicates a happy number, while a cycle which reaches 4 indicates a number that is unhappy. To solve this problem, you'll want to use isPrime and write three other functions:<br><br>
<ol><li><b>sumOfSquaresOfDigits</b> [10 pts]<br>
Write the function sumOfSquaresOfDigits(n) which takes a non-negative integer and returns the sum of the squares of its digits. For example, 123 would become 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14. You should work with the number input directly instead of casting it to a string.</li><br>

<li><b>isHappyNumber</b> [10 pts]<br>
Write the function isHappyNumber(n) which takes a possibly-negative integer and returns True if it is happy and False otherwise. Note that all numbers less than 1 are not happy.</li><br>

<li><b>nthHappyPrime</b> [5 pts]<br>
A happy prime is a number that is both happy and prime. Write the function nthHappyPrime(n) which takes a non-negative integer and returns the nth happy prime number (where the 0th happy prime number is 7).</li>

</ol></li>

<br><li><b>patternedMessage</b> [25 pts]<br>
Write the function patternedMessage(message, pattern) that takes two strings, a message and a pattern, and returns a string produced by replacing the non-whitespace characters in the pattern with the non-whitespace characters in the message (where any leading or trailing newlines in the pattern are first removed).  As a first example:
<br><br>
<table>
<tr><td align="center">call</td><td align="center">result</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<pre>
patternedMessage("Go Pirates!!!", """
***************
******   ******
***************
""")
</pre>
</td><td>
<pre>
GoPirates!!!GoP
irates   !!!GoP
irates!!!GoPira
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br>
Here, the message is "Go Pirates!!!" and the pattern is a block of asterisks with a few missing in the middle.  Notice how the whitespace in the pattern is preserved, but the whitespace in the message is removed.  Again, note that any leading or trailing newlines in the pattern are removed.
<br><br>
Here is another example:
<br><br>
<table>
<tr><td align="center">call</td><td align="center">result</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<pre>
patternedMessage("Three Diamonds!","""
    *     *     *
   ***   ***   ***
  ***** ***** *****
   ***   ***   ***
    *     *     *
""")
</pre>
</td><td>
<pre>
    T     h     r
   eeD   iam   ond
  s!Thr eeDia monds
   !Th   ree   Dia
    m     o     n
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br>
Hint: While you may solve this how you wish, our sample solution did not use replace in any way.
Instead, we started with the empty string, and built up the
result character by character.  How did we determine the next character? Using both the message and the pattern in some way...
<br><br>
And here is one last example, just for fun:
<br><br>
<pre>
patternedMessage("Go Steelers!",
"""
           _ . - = - . _
       . "  \  \   /  /  " .
     ,  \                 /  .
   . \   _,.--~=~"~=~--.._   / .
  ;  _.-"  / \ !   ! / \  "-._  .
 / ,"     / ,` .---. `, \     ". \
/.'   `~  |   /:::::\   |  ~`   '.\
\`.  `~   |   \:::::/   | ~`  ~ .'/
 \ `.  `~ \ `, `~~~' ,` /   ~`.' /
  .  "-._  \ / !   ! \ /  _.-"  .
   ./    "=~~.._  _..~~=`"    \.
     ,/         ""          \,
       . _/             \_ .
          " - ./. .\. - "
""")
</pre>
<br>
Returns this:
<br><br>
<pre>
           _ . - = - . _
       . "  \  \   /  /  " .
     ,  \                 /  .
   . \   _,.--~=~"~=~--.._   / .
  ;  _.-"  / \ !   ! / \  "-._  .
 / ,"     / ,` .---. `, \     ". \
/.'   `~  |   /:::::\   |  ~`   '.\
\`.  `~   |   \:::::/   | ~`  ~ .'/
 \ `.  `~ \ `, `~~~' ,` /   ~`.' /
  .  "-._  \ / !   ! \ /  _.-"  .
   ./    "=~~.._  _..~~=`"    \.
     ,/         ""          \,
       . _/             \_ .
          " - ./. .\. - "</pre>
</li>

<br><li><b>quoteWordCount</b> [25pts]<br>
Write the function quoteWordCount(quote) which takes a quote (represented as a string) and returns the number of spoken words that occur in that quote. We assume that quotes take the form of lines of dialogue separated by newlines, where each line of dialogue is a name, followed by a colon, followed by the spoken words. (Note that colons can occur in spoken words as well). In this context, we define a word to be a sequence of characters that include at least one letter (lower or uppercase), and assume that words are separated by spaces. For example, "hi!!!" would count as a word, but "#$%^%$%^" wouldn't.<br><br>

For example, if we are given the following quote:
<pre>
"""Buttercup: You mock my pain.
Man in Black: Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something."""
</pre>

We would return 15, since 4 words occur in the first line and 11 words occur in the second.</li>

<br><li><b>Bonus/Optional: play112 (The 112 Game)</b> [3 pts]<br>
Read the writeup for "The 112 Game"
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.kosbie.net/cmu/spring-14/15-112/handouts/hw2.html">here</a> (skip to Part B). Be sure to follow the spec exactly, so the autograder can properly grade your work!  As with all bonus, we recommend that you only do this for the joy of learning (which is great), and not for the points (which are modest). <b>Note:</b> yes, you may use strings on this problem.</li>
